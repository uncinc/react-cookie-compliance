# Development

1) Go to the `./example` directory

2) Run `yarn install`

3) Run `yarn start`

# Publishing (testing)

If you want to test locally before publishing you have to use `npm pack`.
Normally you can use `yarn link` or `npm link` but since we have a connected
component, this does not work because it will use react-redux from
dev-dependencies instead of the react-redux from the main app. Besides, using
`npm pack` emulates a package at its best.

1) In the root run `npm pack`, this will generate `<package-name>-<package-version>.tgz`

2) Go to your main app (where you use this package) and run:

```
# Absolute path
yarn add file:///path/to/my-lib/my-lib-1.0.0.tgz

# OR

# Relative path
yarn add ../../path/to/my-lib/my-lib-1.0.0.tgz
```

# Publishing to NPM

Run `npm publish`.

Make sure that any npm modules you want as peer dependencies are properly marked
as `peerDependencies` in `package.json`. The rollup config will automatically
recognize them as peers and not try to bundle them in your module.
